There are many features that are included.  



This package uses the .net framework version 3.0.  You must get it from microsoft.  It is free.


.NET Framework  - http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0856EACB-4362-4B0D-8EDD-AAB15C5E04F5&displaylang=en

Once the .net framework is installed all the programs should run in the folders where they are found.

First you can try the stand alone application.  The shortcut is here in this folder.

All the labview examples are in the labview folder and need labview to be run.  

The python example requires that you have an official python (cpython) distribution.  Once it is installed (this uses version 2.5.2) the bat file
will load the correct script through the linking code.

The visual basic example produces an activex control that can be accessed from excel.  This control must be registered before excel will find it.  I have not 
built an installer to do all this yet.  If you know how this is done, then you can do it now.  I just have not figured out how to install the .net 
components as com objects without the IDE.

You must download and install, scilab if you wish to use it as a script host.  You must also download statconn to act as the bridge.  Here is the site

Good luck and contact me if you need help or have suggestions.
