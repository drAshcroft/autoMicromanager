This uses a special python console that can link the .Net assemblies into the normal python interpretor.  You must have python 2.5.x installed.
This console is located in c:\program files\autoMicromanager\pythonN.exe.  These scripts should run like a normal python 2.5 script with a link 
to the framework.  Further information is available at http://pythonnet.sourceforge.net/readme.html.
